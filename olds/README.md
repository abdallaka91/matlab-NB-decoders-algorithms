# Matlab_NB_LDPC
Different NB_LDPC algorithms based on IEEE papers are implemented. Currently the three algorithms are all symbol flipping based:

1 - GBFDA is an implementation of "Algorithm 1 Serial Enhanced-GBFDA" <in Multiple-Vote Symbol-Flipping Decoder for Nonbinary LDPC Codes> for "Francisco Garc√≠a-Herrero, Erbao Li, David Declercq, Senior Member, IEEE, and Javier Valls"

2 - MV_SF is an implementation of "Algorithm 1 Multiple-Votes Symbol Flipping Algorithm" in <Simplified Symbol Flipping Algorithms for Nonbinary Low-Density Parity-Check Codes> for "Jianyong Zhang, Member, IEEE"

3 - D_SFDP is an implementation of "Algorithm 1: The D-SFDP and P-SFDP Algorithms." in <Randomly Penalized Symbol Flipping Decoding of Non-Binary LDPC Code> for "Zhanzhan Zhao, Xiaopeng Jiao , Jianjun Mu , and Yu-Cheng He, Member, IEEE"
